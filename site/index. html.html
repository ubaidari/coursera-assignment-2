                Butter contributes milk solids and water to a cookie, both of which soften it. Brown sugar contributes molasses – again,
                a softener. Using lower-moisture sugar (granulated) and fat (vegetable shortening), plus a longer, slower bake than
                normal, produces light, crunchy cookies.

                    It makes candy making fun and fool-proof! This entire recipe takes about 20 minutes from chopping the pecans to
                    spreading the chocolate on top. Then you just have to let it chill for awhile while you enjoy a steaming mug of Slow
                    Cooker Peppermint White Hot Chocolate.

                What Is Jelly?
                Jelly is made by extracting fruit juice and cooking it with sugar and pectin (natural or commercially made) to thicken
                it to a firm, but spreadable consistency. It’s often used with whole fruits that have seeds in them or skins, like
                grapes, cranberries, and raspberries. Homemade jelly will have a complex flavor that you may not find in the generic
                jars at grocery stores.
                
                The 3 Ingredients You Need to Make Jelly
                Fruit: If it’s your first time making jelly, use high pectin, high acid type of fruits like tart apples, crabapples,
                cranberries, blackberries, gooseberries, lemons, concord grapes, and currants. The high pectin content ensures a smooth
                and proper gel.
